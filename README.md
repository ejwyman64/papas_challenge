# Papa's Challenge

This website is my attempt to simplify a shared Google spreadsheet that was started by my husband's family to keep track of their fitness challenge. My ultimate hope is that I could have a website that calculates your points for you, all you have to input is what you accomplished that day. 

While the form is not yet functional, you can click the submit button to activate an alert. There is also a surprise button that will reveal a new message when clicked.

My color theme is meant to be sporty and accessible, and it also includeds my husband's hometown colors, dark blue and orange.

I hope you enjoy checking out what I have built, I certainly had a lot of fun working on it :)
