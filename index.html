                <p>This section will talk about how this challenge came to exist and how it can help you reach your goals. Maybe it will even include a quote from some of the creators.</p>

                <h2>Point System Guidlines</h2>
                <p>For each month your goal should be to get 50 points each day. There are four categories for earning points: workouts, steps, food and water, & sleep. Some days this might mean working out a little bit more, some days this might mean focusing on your water intake and eating right. Papa's Challenge was designed to keep you accountable while also being realistic and sustainable.
